===================================

WooCommerce Custom Inventory Report

Add 2 extra meta fields to the inventory tab of each product to set a preferred stock value and backorder value. 
These fields are then used to create a custom report about the inventory of each product based on these values.
Report is visible in the Woocommerce tree.

I created this because the default WooCommerce settings allows only a fixed value for out/low of stock reporting.

I am not a programmer but know some wordpress/woocommerce as shop owner. 

Use of this plugin is without warranties.

Tested on:
Wordpress: 3.6.1
WooCommerce: 2.0.14
